  - python 
  - packages
  - scripts

## Installation

Python venv comes with almost all installations of python

- binary is either `virtualenv`(pre-python 3.4) or `venv`(python 3.4+)
- you can use also direct python call `python -m venv` (recommended)


---
## Usage of virtual Environment

- `python -m venv -p <python interpreter> <name of venv>`
- if you don't specify python interpreter, default is choosen
- `python3.9 -m venv my_venv`
  - creates folder `my_venv`, that will have preinstalled python3.9
  - you must have installed python that you want to use in virtual environment

---

### Activation

Uppon activation `(name of venv)` is added to command prompt.

<br>

#### Linux/Mac

`source <name of venv>/bin/activate` for mac/linux users

<br>

#### Windows

`<name of venv>\Scripts\activate.bat` for cmd.exe

`<name of venv>\Scripts\activate.ps1` for PowerShell

---
### Deactivation

- simple type `deactivate` into command prompt
- `(my_venv)` will disappear from command prompt
---


#### Commands example
- `source my_venv/bin/activate`
- `my_venv\Scripts\activate.bat`
  - you will see `(my_venv)` in command prompt
    - this means, virtual env is activated
